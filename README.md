# gf180mcu_extra_cells

Additional 7-track, 5V standard cells for gf180mcu PDK.

## gf180mcu_as_ex_mcu7t5v0__trans

1- and 2-drive strength transmission gates. As there is no way to characterize them and Iâ€™m uncertain of the liberty file format can even represent the results of such characterization, they are blackboxed for STA. Use with care.

## gf180mcu_as_ex_mcu7t5v0__dfxtp / gf180mcu_as_ex_mcu7t5v0__dfxtp

Positive- and Negative-edge triggered DFFs that are faster than the ones in the default SCL, but at the expense of being physically larger.
